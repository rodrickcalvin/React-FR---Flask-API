## About the Great Bookshelf of Udacity

This project is a virtual bookshelf for Udacity students. Students are able to add their books to the bookshelf, give them a rating, update the rating and search through their book lists. This project will serve as a practice module for the current course. By completing this project, students learn and apply their skills structuring and implementing well-formatted API endpoints that leverage the knowledge of HTTP and API development best practices. 

All backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
